We analysed a paper on the algorithm, transferring the algorithm to our code, and found similar results, which was that using the ART algorithm proves to be significantly more accurate in finding failure regions than random testing due to its more intuitive method of selecting test candidates. Our results found that the ART algorithm  was able to hit the failure region first in comparison to random testing, however it took more time to complete than RT.",
